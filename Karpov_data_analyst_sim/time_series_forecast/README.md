# User-Activity-Forecasting-Orbit

**Project Overview**  

As user activity increases, server load has led to performance 
latency and application "freezes." This project aims to provide a 
data-driven forecast of user activity for the upcoming month. By predicting these trends, 
the results assist DevOps and Engineering teams in proactive infrastructure scaling and resource allocation.

In the project we chose key metric to forecast, utilized the Orbit (Object-Oriented Bayes Imaging Tools) 
framework for its robust Bayesian approach to time-series forecasting. We applied backtesting to evaluate model stability  

**Tech Stack**  
Forecasting Library: Orbit   
Environment: Python  
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy  
Visualization: Matplotlib, Orbit Plotting Utilities
